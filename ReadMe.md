# Classic Hangman (v1.0.0)
### Final Project – Marie Sterzer | 08.08.2024

**🌱 About this project**
This is my very first project in Python after learning the fundamentals of the language. It was an exciting journey into the world of GUI development using Tkinter. While building this simple, classic Hangman game, I learned a lot about creating interactive applications and working with graphical user interfaces.

**🎮 About the Game**
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where you try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters or the entire word. As you make incorrect guesses, a part of the hangman drawing is revealed. The goal is to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn!

 - Guessing: You can guess either a letter or the whole word.
 - Incorrect Guesses: If a letter is guessed incorrectly, a line will be added to the hangman drawing.
 - Winning: If you guess the word before the hangman is completed, you win!
 - Losing: If the hangman is completely drawn, the game is lost.
 - Restart: Press the "Restart" button to play again with a new word.
 - Exit: Close the game with the "Exit" button.

**⚙️ How It Works**
After starting the game, you will be prompted to guess a letter or word. Once you guess, the game will update visually:

 - Correct letters are revealed in the word.
 - Incorrect guesses are added to the hangman drawing and crossed off the list of guessed letters.

**💻 Technologies Used**
 - IDE: VS Code
 - GUI Framework: tkinter
 - Design Tool: Figma with Tkinter-Designer
   → This tool converts Figma designs into code for the GUI.
   → Tutorial: Figma to Tkinter Tutorial
 - AI Assistance: Codeium for code suggestions

**🖼️ Icons and Images**
 - Icons from: Font Awesome
 - Images: Created by me with Figma

**⚠️ Known Issues**
As this is my first Python project, there are still some minor bugs and areas for improvement. I am working on refining the game mechanics and fixing bugs in future updates!
