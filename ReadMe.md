# Whiskerman (v2.0.0)
### Updated Final Project – Marie S. | 27.01.2025

**🌱 About this project**

Whiskerman v2.0.0 is an updated version of my first Python project. After completing the original game, I focused on improving the code and refining the gameplay. This version features cleaner, more maintainable code, as well as some enhancements to the overall experience.

**🎮 About the Game**

Whiskerman is a modern take on the classic Hangman game, with the core gameplay remaining the same but the visuals and interactions getting a fresh update. In this version, you’ll try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters, either by typing them in or selecting from on-screen buttons. When you guess correctly, the letter will be revealed in the word. If you guess wrong, part of the Whiskerman drawing progresses. Your goal is to guess the word before the Whiskerman figure is fully drawn.
Here’s a quick rundown of the gameplay:

 - Guessing: Guess a letter by typing it or choosing from the displayed letter buttons.
 - Incorrect Guesses: Each incorrect guess adds a part to the Whiskerman drawing.
 - Winning: You win if you guess the word before the Whiskerman drawing is completed.
 - Losing: The game ends when the Whiskerman figure is fully drawn.
 - Restart: Press the "Restart" button to play again with a new word.


**🆕 What's New in v2.0.0**

 - New Visuals: The classic Hangman figure has been replaced with a unique Whiskerman design.
 - Updated Gameplay: The guessing process has been made smoother with an interactive letter button interface.
 - Enhanced Code Structure: The code has been refactored for better readability and long-term maintainability.
 - Bug Fixes: Several minor issues from the first version have been addressed for a smoother experience.
 - No Exit Button: The exit button has been removed to focus on the in-game experience.
